/**
 * ZenReader - Style Manager Module
 *
 * This script serves as the main entry point for style-related functionality,
 * coordinating between the various style modules.
 */

// This file intentionally left mostly empty as its functionality has been
// distributed to the specialized style modules. This architecture allows
// for future expansion of style-related features.

/**
 * The style manager primarily coordinates between:
 * - styleCache.js - For caching computed styles
 * - elementCloner.js - For cloning elements with preserved styles
 * - shadowDomStyles.js - For managing shadow DOM style content
 * - layoutFixer.js - For fixing common layout issues (functionality included in domUtils.js)
